## Objectives

## Overview

## Dependencies
Versions :
- C++20
- Compiler g++ 13.2.0

For now, it works only on Linux distribution because of the use of the `libevdev` library

## Usage
1- Make sure to have the Makefile, the`.cpp` and `.h` files in the current directory

2- Command `make` to compile the code

3- you should have an executable `keystrokeDB`, execute it with :
```bash
sudo ./keystrokeDB
```
Note : The `libevdev` library needs to be run as root.

4- Command `make clean` to delete the `.o` files and the executable or directly use `make clean all Ã¨ if you want to delete all and recompile directly.
